## Bug Fixes And Course FAQ

### Fix: Edge Function Middleware Limitations on Vercel

After deploying your app you may be getting a build error along the lines of:

> The Edge Function "middleware size is 1.03 MB and your plan size limit is 1MB

For the solution to resolve this please see Brads [Gist here](https://gist.github.com/bradtraversy/16e3c89b9b25bc79cf86f5f36e14e83d)

There is also a new lesson added for this fix at the end of the course -
**Vercel Hobby Tier Fix**

### Bug: A newly logged in user can inherit the previous users cart

If a logged in user adds items to their cart and logs out then a different user
logs in on the same machine, they will inherit the first users cart.

To fix this we can delete the current users **Cart** from the database in our **lib/actions/user.actions.ts** `signOutUser` action.

> Changes can be seen in [lib/actions/user.actions.ts](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/a498d4362d1485b2bd3152124cb5c3a75f8fdd70/lib/actions/user.actions.ts#L45)

### Bug: Any user can see another users order

If a user knows the `Order.id` of another users order it is possible for them to
visit **/order/<Order.id>** and see that other users order. This isn't likely to
happen in reality but should be something we protect against by redirecting the
user to our **/unauthorized** page if they are not the owner of the order.

In **app/(root)/order/[id]/page.tsx** we can import the `redirect` function from Next:

```ts
import { notFound, redirect } from 'next/navigation';
```

Then check if the user is the owner of the order and redirect them if not:

```ts
// Redirect the user if they don't own the order
if (order.userId !== session?.user.id && session?.user.role !== 'admin') {
  return redirect('/unauthorized');
}
```

> Changes can be seen in [app/(root)/order/[id]/page.tsx](<https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/main/app/(root)/order/%5Bid%5D/page.tsx>)

### Bug: Cart add and remove buttons share loading animation

On our **/cart** page you may notice that when you increment or decrement the
quantity of an item in the cart, then the loader shows for all buttons after we
click. This is because all the buttons use the same **pending** state from our
use of `useTransition` in our [app/(root)/cart/cart-table.tsx](<https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/main/app/(root)/cart/cart-table.tsx>)

We can solve this by breaking out the Buttons into their own `AddButton` and
`RemoveButton` components, each using their own `useTransition` and so having
their own **pending** state.

You can if you wish move these components to their own files/modules but for
ease of following along they can be seen in the same file.

> Changes can be seen in [app/(root)/cart/cart-table.tsx](<https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/main/app/(root)/cart/cart-table.tsx>)

### FAQ: Why are we using a JS click event in not-found

In our [app/not-found.tsx](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/main/app/not-found.tsx) we currently have:

```tsx
<Button
  variant='outline'
  className='mt-4 ml-2'
  onClick={() => (window.location.href = '/')}
>
  Back To Home
</Button>
```

So we navigate the user back to the home page with a JavaScript click event,
but this should really be a `<a />` (link) instead.

So we can change the code to:

```tsx
<Button variant='outline' className='mt-4 ml-2' asChild>
  <Link href='/'>Back To Home</Link>
</Button>
```

### Fix: TypeScript no-explicit-any in auth.ts

You may be seeing warnings from TS in your **auth.ts** and **auth.config.ts**
about using the `any` Type.

Normally the Types are inferred from NextAuth, and you don't need to do anything.  
Here however it's `any` because we added in other properties to the `JWT`, `User` and the `Session` Types, namely **role**, **sub** and **name**.
So because the callbacks no longer match the built in types, then TS defaults to `any`
The correct way to remedy it would be to tell TS about those additions by [ Augmenting ](https://next-auth.js.org/getting-started/typescript#module-augmentation) the **NextAuth** types.

So if you haven't already then you would need to create a **types/next-auth.d.ts** file with the following:

```ts
import { DefaultSession } from 'next-auth';

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';

// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars
import { JWT } from 'next-auth/jwt';

declare module 'next-auth/jwt' {
  /** Returned by the `jwt` callback and `getToken`, when using JWT sessions */
  interface JWT {
    sub: string;
    role: string;
    name: string;
  }
}

declare module 'next-auth' {
  /**
   * Returned by `useSession`, `getSession` and received as a prop on the `SessionProvider` React Context
   */
  interface Session {
    user: {
      role: string;
    } & DefaultSession['user'];
  }

  interface User {
    role: string;
  }
}
```

This augments the built in types so TS will know about our modifications.

You can then remove the use of the `any` type in **auth.ts** and **auth.config.ts**.  
You will also need to define the `config` object directly in the `NextAuth`
constructor, rather than creating the config object first.

## TailwindCSS Update: Breaking Changes

Many of you are running into issues following the course because **TailwindCSS recently had a major update**.  
By default, you'll install the latest version (**Tailwind v4**), but the course was recorded with **Tailwind v3**.

### Option 1: Stick with Tailwind v3 (Matches the Course)

If you want to follow the course exactly, you should install **Tailwind v3** and refer to the v3 docs:  
:link: **[Tailwind v3 Setup for Next.js](https://v3.tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs)**  
Make sure your **tailwind.config.ts** matches [this file](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/main/tailwind.config.ts)

### Option 2: Use Tailwind v4 (Updated Code Available, this seems to be the smoothest option)

If you'd rather use **Tailwind v4**, there is a **`tailwind4`** branch of this repository where you can grab the updated code:  
:link: **[Updated Repo](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/tree/tailwind4)**

### Changes Needed for Tailwind v4:

- **Delete** `tailwind.config.ts` (if it exists).
- **Update** `globals.css` to match [this file](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/tailwind4/assets/styles/globals.css).
- **Update** `postcss.config.mjs` to match [this file](https://github.com/bradtraversy/prostore/blob/tailwind4/postcss.config.mjs)
- If you're using the latest Next.js, these should be the only changes required.
- Make sure you have the `tailwindcss-animate` package installed - `npm i tailwindcss-animate`

### Migrating from Tailwind v3 to v4 Mid-Course?

If you've already started the course with **Tailwind v3**, some **Radix UI components may break** due to class name changes.  
The easiest fix is to use Tailwind's migration tool:

```sh
npx @tailwindcss/upgrade
```

### :link: Upgrade Guide

If you use the migration tool, you don't need to manually:

- :white_check_mark: Update globals.css (the tool handles it).
- :white_check_mark: Delete tailwind.config.ts.

If you run into issues, please post over on **Discord** or in the **Udemy Q&A**
for the course.
